PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED:
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JAVASCRIPT

INITIALLY NO BOOKS ARE ADDED IN THE LIBRARY. ADMIN MUST ADD BOOKS.

WORK FLOW:
•	The web page begins from INDEX.HTML  FILE where it displays the details and contact of the Learning center. Here the main page is completely working on the LOAD ON SCROLL MECHANISM.
•	From this page we can either move to ADMIN OR USER PAGE.

•	ADMIN:
•	Admin can only add the books or delete the books to the library. 

•	NOTE:
INITIALLY NO BOOKS ARE ADDED IN THE LIBRARY. ADMIN MUST ADD BOOKS.
•	By clicking admin it asks for logging in. If the admin is new to the learning center then click on the signup button. In log in page we should give our email id and password to go for further processes. In sign up page we must enter our name, mail id and password to create a new account. 
•	Then the admin page redirects to library page where admin can add the books by providing the BOOK NAME,AUTHOR NAME,DATE OF PUBLISHING AND THE GENRE. 
•	If admin is interested to view the books in the library then click on the book list button. Then it redirects to a page where all books are shown.Here I have implemented PAGINATION(10,25,50,100) any of the choices can be selected. In this page admin can either delete any particular book or can completely delete all their data. I have also added search button to search our specific book.

•	USER:
•	User can only view list of books present in the library. 
•	By clicking the user in the main page it redirects to log in page same as admin. If you are a new user then must sign up.
•	User page redirects to book list page where user can view all the books in library.
•	Pagination is provided in this page. If the user wants to search any book in random search bar is present to search their needs.
•	If the user wants to SEARCH BY FILTERS like(book name/author name/publish date/genre) then must click the search by filter button where it shows the dropdown view. We can select any of the filter and search the respective book.
